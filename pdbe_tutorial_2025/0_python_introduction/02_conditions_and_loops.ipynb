Python's conditional statements match those of many other programming languages, so the conditions you learn here will be applicable throughout your programming journey. \n","\n","Let's begin by thinking about how a condition works in programming. Essentially, we write a statement in code that checks if something is either true or false. If the condition is true, then the block of code below is executed.
